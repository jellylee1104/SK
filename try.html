          <p>Profession: Firefighter <br>Age: 25 <br>Friend: B, D, E, “Stephanie” <br>Relationship: in love with D</p>
          <h5>Story:</h5>
          <p>The story begins in secondary 3; you’re in the friend group with roles B, D, E and Glady (Glady is another girl who is already dead). You guys are excellent friends. However, the nightmare just began. One day you guys find out that Glady is being sad and constantly crying, but she didn’t tell you guys why, and you start to see some pain in her body. You decide to inform B and persuade B to talk to her as B and Glady have a relationship. Yet you were told that Glady is drowning on the next day in the news, and you are being guilty, blaming yourself; you should ask her when you find out the pain. The odd thing is that the news reported that when they find Glady, there is a water drop painted on her face with purple lipstick. By that time, you only think that she is being sad and has decided to suicide. You swear that you will be a person that can save people, and you become a firefighter. You and D had a crush in secondary 5 and decided to have a relationship a year later. Once, on a mission, you met Stephanie, saved her life, and you and D started being friends with her as you think she is miserable. She told us that she is studying in the same secondary school in the same year but left in secondary 3. Then, Stephanie joined a friend group including you, B and E. E and Stephanie soon have a relationship. In one gathering with D and Stephanie, when she went to the toilet and didn’t take her phone with her, you and D saw C send a message to Stephanie. The message says, “Don’t you dare threaten me; I will still pursue your brother! If you ever let him and the whole world see those videos, I will tell the whole world that you killed Glady!”. You and D are so shocked; however, you didn’t fully trust this message, you took a picture and decide to ask her later. On the next day, you know she is an accountant and went to her office. You saw her bulling F but according to what she told you she said she is the one who is being bullied. You are so angry, but you still decide to continue to pretend to be friends with Stephanie, but decide to murder her together in the gathering two weeks later as you are filled with anger. Moreover, as E is having a relationship with Stephanie, so you guys start alienating her as you guys don’t want her to suffer in pain and do the revenge yourselves, which suggests that the friend group only remain A, B and D.</p>
          <p>On the day of gathering with the teachers in your secondary school, you and D decided to murder Stephanie by hanging her up pretend that she is suicide and that she is fear when she looks at the words on the toilet door (such as writing “YOU KILLED ME!”, “YOU DON’T DESERVE WHAT YOU HAVE NOW!”). And draw a water drop on her face using purple lipstick, just like how Glady dead.        </p>
          <h5>Timeline:</h5>
          <p>The gathering starts at 17:45</p>
          <p>16:57 – you and D arrived at the school and started playing basketball. Then you saw E & Stephanie come and go to the hall directly. Next came C and joined you to play basketball. After a while, F came and went to the hall; finally came B and she joined the basketball team to play.        </p>
          <p>17:45 – The gathering starts and all of you go to the hall to watch the performance.</p>
          <p>19:00 – End performance and a break for students and teachers to chat. You walked with D to find teachers.        </p>
          <p>19:12 – You separated from D and went to the toilet yourself to prepare for the murder. You take out the rope you prepared and find a space to hang it up; you put it in the ceiling of the last toilet compartment. At around 19:15, you did this preparation and ran into B in front of the toilet.        </p>
          <p>19:16 – You find D and continue to talk to teachers together.        </p>
          <p>19:21 - You separate from D again as she says she wants to go to the toilet; you start wondering and after around 2 minutes, hear Stephanie tell E that she is not feeling well and she is going to the toilet, knowing that she is going by herself and she knows this may be one opportunity. However, you decided to wait for D.        </p>
          <p>19:25 – D returned and told you that it will be obvious if she goes to the toilet again now, and you guys decided to stick to your original plan.</p>
          <p>19:35 – You guys find out that Stephanie is still in the toilet and you decide to kill her now. When you entered the toilet, you saw her lying on the toilet seat with her eyes closed. However, D still stuns Stephanie with the stun spray and you guys hang her up by the rope together. You have completed the murder. While D pull out all the liquid in the stun spray and filled with water, you write words on the toilet door. (“YOU KILLED ME!”, “YOU DON’T DESERVE WHAT YOU HAVE NOW!”) and draw a water drop on her face using purple lipstick. You then throw the whiteboard pen and the lipstick into the bin.</p>
          <p>19:37 – You guys went out of the toilet and found a teacher to chat. In the meantime, you saw F go into the toilet; however, she went out so quickly and didn’t scream or say that she saw Stephanie hanging up. Instead, she pretends nothing has happened.</p>
          <p>19:45 – Dinner time starts, you and D go back to the hall and notice that everyone except Stephanie arrived already.</p>
          <p>19:50 – Stephanie is still not here and E said she hasn’t found her since 19:25 and said she might not feel well. We all go and find her, and finally find that she is hung up in the toilet with words on the door.</p>

          <p>Profession: Psychologist <br>Age: 25 <br>Friend: A, C, D, E <br>Relationship: in love with Glady in age 15</p>
          <h5>Story:</h5>
          <p>The story begins in secondary 3; you’re in the friend group with roles A, D, E and Glady (Glady is another girl who is already dead); you guys are excellent friends; however, the nightmare just began. Glady is your girlfriend by that time, you are still in love with her. One day you guys find out that Glady is being sad and constantly crying, but she doesn’t tell you guys why; you always stay by her side and know that she really suffers in pain. You decided not to ask her so she could slowly forget what happened; however, A told you that she saw some scars and pain in her body, and you determined that you needed to find out what suffered her. On that day, you trace Glady and see her being kidnapped; you take a taxi to trace Glady and see she was brought to a swimming pool; you then call 999 and go inside. When you get there, you see Stephanie’s back running away, and Glady is in the water. At this point, you hesitate for one second, and you hear a beeping sound. You ran over to Glady and pulled her out from the water to do the first aid. You see a water drop painted on her face with purple lipstick. However, the doctor announced she was dead when Glady arrived at the hospital. You swear that you will revenge on Stephanie and tell the police that you saw her running away when you arrived. Still, as she is underage at 18 and there is no real evidence that points out she is the murderer in that case. However, Stephanie left school, and you never saw her again.        </p>
          <p>After this incident, you decided to be a psychologist and help people to speak out their voices and to divorce out of pain. 5 years after graduating from secondary school, A brought Stephanie into the friend group and told us that she was suffering from pain, and her behaviour suggests that she has a mental disorder which you suspect yourself whether Stephanie really killed Glady. 1 year later after being friends with Stephanie, C came into your clinic and asked for help. C told you that she is involved in that murder case. Still, she had no choice as Stephanie has videos of her being raped, which is a nightmare to her. If she doesn’t listen to her then Stephanie sends these videos to everyone. C told you that Stephanie bullied Glady, and Glady reported it to the teacher. Stephanie told C to kidnap her into the swimming pool, but she didn’t know what happened next. C said she was so guilty at that time, but you didn’t blame her as she is one of the sufferers and she is being used by Stephanie. C said Stephanie had disappeared since then, but she appears now and intimidates her with these videos, making her have nightmares each day. You didn’t blame C and you helped her, you gave her a medicine that will help her from overthinking. You then decided to revenge and make Stephanie miserable. As Glady’s old phone is by your hand, you then use her phone to send her threatening message throughout the year and make her feel guilty.        </p>
          <p>On the day of gathering with the teachers in your secondary school, you decided to intimidate Stephanie by pretending that Glady’s soul possessed your body and asking her why to make her suffer more mentally. Then you decided to put a medicine (name: Wamite) to make her insane. You think this is the best way to best way to revenge is to make her life worse than death.</p>
          <h5>Timeline:</h5>
          <p>The gathering starts at 17:45</p>
          <p>17:39 – You arrive at the school and notice that A, C, and D have already arrived. You then join them to play basketball.</p>
          <p>17:45 – You saw E, F and Stephanie in the hall, and the gathering starts there to watch the performance.</p>
          <p>19:00 – End performance and a break for students and teachers to chat. You walked to find teachers by yourself.</p>
          <p>19:15 – You met A in front of the toilet and had a small greeting; then you went into the toilet and saw a rope hanging in the ceiling of the last toilet compartment.</p>
          <p>19:24 – You saw Stephanie going to the toilet and decided now is the time to intimidate Stephanie by pretending that Glady’s soul possessed into your body. You asked, “Why did you bully me? What have I done? Tell me!” And she was so threatening and ran into the toilet.</p>
          <p>19:25 – You find C and E to find teachers together.</p>
          <p>19:41 – You use an excuse to go to the toilet to split up with C and E, and you go back to the hall. As planned, you are the first one to arrive, and you put Wamite into Stephanie’s food to make her insane. Then you throw the medicine box in the rubbish bin.</p>
          <p>19:45 – Dinner time starts, you and E arrive at the hall, then F comes and finally, A and D.</p>
          <p>19:50 – Stephanie is still not here and E said she still hasn’t found her since 19:25 and said she might not be feeling well. We all go and find her, and finally find that she is hung up in the toilet with words on the door.</p>

          <p>Profession: Dancer <br>Age: 25 <br>Friend: B, E <br>Relationship: enemy with Stephanie</p>
          <h5>Story:</h5>
          <p>The story begins in secondary 3 and it is your nightmare. One day after school, you were kidnapped and raped by 3 guys. You saw Stephanie is on the side and filming the whole process. The next day, Stephanie finds you and commands you to listen to her. Stephanie had a horrible temper at that time. Whenever she has a bad mood, she will punch you and Glady (another girl which already dead). On one Monday, Glady told you that she reported to the teacher that Stephanie was bullying her and the teacher decided to suspend her for 2 days. Stephanie was so angry and told you she would delete those videos if you brought Glady to the swimming pool after school. You find people to kidnap her to the swimming pool and think that Stephanie will bully her such as before. You refuse to look at what will happen as you feel that you betrayed Glady and decided to compensate her after Stephanie deleted the photos. However, the news reported a girl drowning in the swimming pool; you know that girl is Glady. You are so guilty, and you got depression and suffer mental pain.</p>
          <p>It starts to get better after being a dancer and you are more confident; you then have a boyfriend one day in the sixth year of graduation from secondary school. You are gathering with your boyfriend's family and you meet Stephanie again as she is your boyfriend's sister. You know that E is now having a relationship with Stephanie. After gathering with your boyfriend's family, you decide to tell E the truth; she has the right to know that as Glady is her best friend by that time. You tell her what you know about Glady's death, and send her the screenshot of Stephanie sending you your rape video with the message, "Give me five hundred thousand or else I will send these videos to my brother and the whole world". She didn’t answer you but you know that she hasn’t fully trust you.</p>
          <p>Your depression gets worst, and you finally decide to see a psychologist; this person is B. You know that she had a relationship with Glady at that time, and she is a friend of E. However, there is a chance that B hates you or decides to revenge on you, but you decided to stop things from going wrong and told B the whole thing. She said to you that she didn't blame you and helped you, which made the condition of your depression get much better. She gave you medicine (name: Wamite) to prevent overthinking and help your depression.</p>
          <h5>Timeline:</h5>
          <p>The gathering starts at 17:45</p>

          <p>19:25 – E comes and finds you, and you guys walk together; you ask her, “After you know she is a vicious person, you still want to be in a relationship with her?”. She said she needed some time to digest this information and decide what to do, as this was cruel to her.</p>

          <p>Profession: Firefighter <br>Age: 25 <br>Friend: B, D, E, “Stephanie” <br>Relationship: in love with D</p>
          <h5>Story:</h5>
          <p>The story begins in secondary 3; you’re in the friend group with roles B, D, E and Glady (Glady is another girl who is already dead). You guys are excellent friends. However, the nightmare just began. One day you guys find out that Glady is being sad and constantly crying, but she didn’t tell you guys why, and you start to see some pain in her body. You decide to inform B and persuade B to talk to her as B and Glady have a relationship. Yet you were told that Glady is drowning on the next day in the news, and you are being guilty, blaming yourself; you should ask her when you find out the pain. The odd thing is that the news reported that when they find Glady, there is a water drop painted on her face with purple lipstick. By that time, you only think that she is being sad and has decided to suicide. You swear that you will be a person that can save people, and you become a firefighter. You and D had a crush in secondary 5 and decided to have a relationship a year later. Once, on a mission, you met Stephanie, saved her life, and you and D started being friends with her as you think she is miserable. She told us that she is studying in the same secondary school in the same year but left in secondary 3. Then, Stephanie joined a friend group including you, B and E. E and Stephanie soon have a relationship. In one gathering with D and Stephanie, when she went to the toilet and didn’t take her phone with her, you and D saw C send a message to Stephanie. The message says, “Don’t you dare threaten me; I will still pursue your brother! If you ever let him and the whole world see those videos, I will tell the whole world that you killed Glady!”. You and D are so shocked; however, you didn’t fully trust this message, you took a picture and decide to ask her later. On the next day, you know she is an accountant and went to her office. You saw her bulling F but according to what she told you she said she is the one who is being bullied. You are so angry, but you still decide to continue to pretend to be friends with Stephanie, but decide to murder her together in the gathering two weeks later as you are filled with anger. Moreover, as E is having a relationship with Stephanie, so you guys start alienating her as you guys don’t want her to suffer in pain and do the revenge yourselves, which suggests that the friend group only remain A, B and D.</p>
          <p>On the day of gathering with the teachers in your secondary school, you and D decided to murder Stephanie by hanging her up pretend that she is suicide and that she is fear when she looks at the words on the toilet door (such as writing “YOU KILLED ME!”, “YOU DON’T DESERVE WHAT YOU HAVE NOW!”). And draw a water drop on her face using purple lipstick, just like how Glady dead.        </p>
          <h5>Timeline:</h5>
          <p>The gathering starts at 17:45</p>
          <p>16:57 – you and D arrived at the school and started playing basketball. Then you saw E & Stephanie come and go to the hall directly. Next came C and joined you to play basketball. After a while, F came and went to the hall; finally came B and she joined the basketball team to play.        </p>
          <p>17:45 – The gathering starts and all of you go to the hall to watch the performance.</p>
          <p>19:00 – End performance and a break for students and teachers to chat. You walked with D to find teachers.        </p>
          <p>19:12 – You separated from D and went to the toilet yourself to prepare for the murder. You take out the rope you prepared and find a space to hang it up; you put it in the ceiling of the last toilet compartment. At around 19:15, you did this preparation and ran into B in front of the toilet.        </p>
          <p>19:16 – You find D and continue to talk to teachers together.        </p>
          <p>19:21 - You separate from D again as she says she wants to go to the toilet; you start wondering and after around 2 minutes, hear Stephanie tell E that she is not feeling well and she is going to the toilet, knowing that she is going by herself and she knows this may be one opportunity. However, you decided to wait for D.        </p>
          <p>19:25 – D returned and told you that it will be obvious if she goes to the toilet again now, and you guys decided to stick to your original plan.</p>
          <p>19:35 – You guys find out that Stephanie is still in the toilet and you decide to kill her now. When you entered the toilet, you saw her lying on the toilet seat with her eyes closed. However, D still stuns Stephanie with the stun spray and you guys hang her up by the rope together. You have completed the murder. While D pull out all the liquid in the stun spray and filled with water, you write words on the toilet door. (“YOU KILLED ME!”, “YOU DON’T DESERVE WHAT YOU HAVE NOW!”) and draw a water drop on her face using purple lipstick. You then throw the whiteboard pen and the lipstick into the bin.</p>
          <p>19:37 – You guys went out of the toilet and found a teacher to chat. In the meantime, you saw F go into the toilet; however, she went out so quickly and didn’t scream or say that she saw Stephanie hanging up. Instead, she pretends nothing has happened.</p>
          <p>19:45 – Dinner time starts, you and D go back to the hall and notice that everyone except Stephanie arrived already.</p>
          <p>19:50 – Stephanie is still not here and E said she hasn’t found her since 19:25 and said she might not feel well. We all go and find her, and finally find that she is hung up in the toilet with words on the door.</p>

          <p>Profession: Psychologist <br>Age: 25 <br>Friend: A, C, D, E <br>Relationship: in love with Glady in age 15</p>
          <h5>Story:</h5>
          <p>The story begins in secondary 3; you’re in the friend group with roles A, D, E and Glady (Glady is another girl who is already dead); you guys are excellent friends; however, the nightmare just began. Glady is your girlfriend by that time, you are still in love with her. One day you guys find out that Glady is being sad and constantly crying, but she doesn’t tell you guys why; you always stay by her side and know that she really suffers in pain. You decided not to ask her so she could slowly forget what happened; however, A told you that she saw some scars and pain in her body, and you determined that you needed to find out what suffered her. On that day, you trace Glady and see her being kidnapped; you take a taxi to trace Glady and see she was brought to a swimming pool; you then call 999 and go inside. When you get there, you see Stephanie’s back running away, and Glady is in the water. At this point, you hesitate for one second, and you hear a beeping sound. You ran over to Glady and pulled her out from the water to do the first aid. You see a water drop painted on her face with purple lipstick. However, the doctor announced she was dead when Glady arrived at the hospital. You swear that you will revenge on Stephanie and tell the police that you saw her running away when you arrived. Still, as she is underage at 18 and there is no real evidence that points out she is the murderer in that case. However, Stephanie left school, and you never saw her again.        </p>
          <p>After this incident, you decided to be a psychologist and help people to speak out their voices and to divorce out of pain. 5 years after graduating from secondary school, A brought Stephanie into the friend group and told us that she was suffering from pain, and her behaviour suggests that she has a mental disorder which you suspect yourself whether Stephanie really killed Glady. 1 year later after being friends with Stephanie, C came into your clinic and asked for help. C told you that she is involved in that murder case. Still, she had no choice as Stephanie has videos of her being raped, which is a nightmare to her. If she doesn’t listen to her then Stephanie sends these videos to everyone. C told you that Stephanie bullied Glady, and Glady reported it to the teacher. Stephanie told C to kidnap her into the swimming pool, but she didn’t know what happened next. C said she was so guilty at that time, but you didn’t blame her as she is one of the sufferers and she is being used by Stephanie. C said Stephanie had disappeared since then, but she appears now and intimidates her with these videos, making her have nightmares each day. You didn’t blame C and you helped her, you gave her a medicine that will help her from overthinking. You then decided to revenge and make Stephanie miserable. As Glady’s old phone is by your hand, you then use her phone to send her threatening message throughout the year and make her feel guilty.        </p>
          <p>On the day of gathering with the teachers in your secondary school, you decided to intimidate Stephanie by pretending that Glady’s soul possessed your body and asking her why to make her suffer more mentally. Then you decided to put a medicine (name: Wamite) to make her insane. You think this is the best way to best way to revenge is to make her life worse than death.</p>
          <h5>Timeline:</h5>
          <p>The gathering starts at 17:45</p>
          <p>17:39 – You arrive at the school and notice that A, C, and D have already arrived. You then join them to play basketball.</p>
          <p>17:45 – You saw E, F and Stephanie in the hall, and the gathering starts there to watch the performance.</p>
          <p>19:00 – End performance and a break for students and teachers to chat. You walked to find teachers by yourself.</p>
          <p>19:15 – You met A in front of the toilet and had a small greeting; then you went into the toilet and saw a rope hanging in the ceiling of the last toilet compartment.</p>
          <p>19:24 – You saw Stephanie going to the toilet and decided now is the time to intimidate Stephanie by pretending that Glady’s soul possessed into your body. You asked, “Why did you bully me? What have I done? Tell me!” And she was so threatening and ran into the toilet.</p>
          <p>19:25 – You find C and E to find teachers together.</p>
          <p>19:41 – You use an excuse to go to the toilet to split up with C and E, and you go back to the hall. As planned, you are the first one to arrive, and you put Wamite into Stephanie’s food to make her insane. Then you throw the medicine box in the rubbish bin.</p>
          <p>19:45 – Dinner time starts, you and E arrive at the hall, then F comes and finally, A and D.</p>
          <p>19:50 – Stephanie is still not here and E said she still hasn’t found her since 19:25 and said she might not be feeling well. We all go and find her, and finally find that she is hung up in the toilet with words on the door.</p>

          <p>Profession: Dancer <br>Age: 25 <br>Friend: B, E <br>Relationship: enemy with Stephanie</p>
          <h5>Story:</h5>
          <p>The story begins in secondary 3 and it is your nightmare. One day after school, you were kidnapped and raped by 3 guys. You saw Stephanie is on the side and filming the whole process. The next day, Stephanie finds you and commands you to listen to her. Stephanie had a horrible temper at that time. Whenever she has a bad mood, she will punch you and Glady (another girl which already dead). On one Monday, Glady told you that she reported to the teacher that Stephanie was bullying her and the teacher decided to suspend her for 2 days. Stephanie was so angry and told you she would delete those videos if you brought Glady to the swimming pool after school. You find people to kidnap her to the swimming pool and think that Stephanie will bully her such as before. You refuse to look at what will happen as you feel that you betrayed Glady and decided to compensate her after Stephanie deleted the photos. However, the news reported a girl drowning in the swimming pool; you know that girl is Glady. You are so guilty, and you got depression and suffer mental pain.</p>
          <p>It starts to get better after being a dancer and you are more confident; you then have a boyfriend one day in the sixth year of graduation from secondary school. You are gathering with your boyfriend's family and you meet Stephanie again as she is your boyfriend's sister. You know that E is now having a relationship with Stephanie. After gathering with your boyfriend's family, you decide to tell E the truth; she has the right to know that as Glady is her best friend by that time. You tell her what you know about Glady's death, and send her the screenshot of Stephanie sending you your rape video with the message, "Give me five hundred thousand or else I will send these videos to my brother and the whole world". She didn’t answer you but you know that she hasn’t fully trust you.</p>
          <p>Your depression gets worst, and you finally decide to see a psychologist; this person is B. You know that she had a relationship with Glady at that time, and she is a friend of E. However, there is a chance that B hates you or decides to revenge on you, but you decided to stop things from going wrong and told B the whole thing. She said to you that she didn't blame you and helped you, which made the condition of your depression get much better. She gave you medicine (name: Wamite) to prevent overthinking and help your depression.</p>
          <h5>Timeline:</h5>
          <p>The gathering starts at 17:45</p>

          <p>19:25 – E comes and finds you, and you guys walk together; you ask her, “After you know she is a vicious person, you still want to be in a relationship with her?”. She said she needed some time to digest this information and decide what to do, as this was cruel to her.</p>
          <p>19:26 – You guys saw B and walked together, which led to the end of your conversation with E</p>
          <p>19:41 – B said she needed to go to the toilet, and she left. You and E continue to talk to the teacher.</p>
